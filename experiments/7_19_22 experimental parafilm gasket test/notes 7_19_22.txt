testing for V3.5 a gasket top SLA printed and volumes measured and calculated.

How much volume is in the screw in luer locks?

1. place screw in luer lock in weigh boat and weigh before adding water
2. fill up screw up luer lock with water and remeasure

result = 0.2g = 20uL



calulated volume:

opening in parafilm gasket = 13x32mm = 416 mm^2
parafilm thickness = 0.12mm (might be compressed to 0.1mm though)
volume in parafilm gasket = 50 uL

volume in screw in luer locks + volume in gasket = 90uL


to test this:

1. place gasket on glass plate
2. add on the upper with installed screw in luer locks
3. place on scale and zero out
4. add in fluid to tops of screw in luer locks
5. weight again to find volume of water. doesnt matter with this if water fell out of the gasket.

result = 50uL of water to fill up
