3-31-22 multiplex trial on autocif

Used for stain order: 3_31_22 4 rd trial.excel

1. Autofocus still cant seem to work well enough with binning camera
2. Micromagellan initially seeds 4gb blocks for each level (13 in total) and then reduces from there. If you dont have the ehad room to accomodate that initially, it runs out of room and throws an error. 
3. Works directly saving to drive, but takes about 10 minutes to do a 7 tile image.
