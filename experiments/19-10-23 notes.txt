1:16 pm staining starts

antibodies are chromogranin A-488, ecad-555, and muc2-647. All at 1:1000 [C]

didnt get to use script as messed up start. To pivot,I used a MDA in Mm to acquire the images. It was started about 5 minutes after the stain was placed onto the slide. 

Bleach solution was used at 2mM instead of the normal 10mM concentration. This was done to slow down the reaction and get better effective resolution on the k value.
