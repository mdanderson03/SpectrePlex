spot repeatibility experiment with autofocus

obsdervation auto focus typically works very well. In final image, seemingly random tiles are out of focus. Why? 

Experiment:

1. In one spot autofocus 3 times
2. wait 5 mintues
3. auto focus 3 times
4. move 3mm x 3mm 
5. wait 5 mintues
6. move back to original location and autofocus 3 times
7. move 3mmx3mm
8. move back to original spot autofocus 3 times
9. repeat 7 and 8 3 more times. 

spot location x: -8919, Y: 6513
displacement vector = X: -3mm, Y:-3mm

z range:
center = 1100
scan range = +-50um
